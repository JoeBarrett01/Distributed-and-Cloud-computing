Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Bilal Mustafa Sheikh, and I am a third-year computer science undergraduate student at Cardiff University. I am currently working on my final year project, and as a part of it, I have developed a mobile application.

With the approval of the ethics committee, I would like to request permission to broadcast an email to potential students for the trial of my mobile application. The aim of this trial is to gather feedback from students on the functionality and usability of the application. 

I have attached the broadcast email to this email, which includes a detailed explanation of the trial.

Best regards,

Bilal Mustafa Sheikh
