Close the server and attempt connecting using the client. What happens and why?
    - The client is unable to connect because there is no server. 

What is distribution transparency? Using sockets for communication does not offer
distribution transparency. Justify this statement (hint: there are a number of reasons
including naming in the context of location transparency. Also consider the previous
question).
    - Distribution transparency is the property of distributed databases by 
      the virtue of which the internal details of the distribution are hidden from the users.

    - The socket cannot provide distribution transparency since we would be able to find
      the location of the socket from the stub given requesting data. 

Think about how you would design a middleware for communication built using sockets
which offers greater distribution transparency than sockets.
    - I would pass my connection through a TOR.
