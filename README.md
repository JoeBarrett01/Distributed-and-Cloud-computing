### Installation and Running the Code
***
Data required: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mqoh7gG-g3Sc3Zh6zEO8o2sKBpdSeFiJ/view
Instructions to run code
* To run using Google Colab:
Upload the dataset to Google Drive using this file path “ /content/drive/MyDrive/Pre-processing/ “
* To run this in a Jupyter Notebook
Ensure the dataset is in the same folder as your notebook file, and use the commented out line of code in the notebook
“ read_data = pd.read_csv(“opinion_fact_news.csv”) “
* Once the data is imported you can run through the notebook where the data will go through a pre-processing pipeline, and train the four models.
* At the end of the notebook there is testing on an external dataset that can be downloaded here:
